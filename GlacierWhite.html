            Wireless Bluetooth earbuds engineered by Bose for your best workout yet.
            Bose lifelike sound—makes your music sound like the performer is right there beside you, pushing you to go one more mile or do one more rep.
            Secure and comfortable earbuds—customise your fit with the included 3 sizes of StayHear Max tips that won’t hurt your ears and won’t fall out no matter tough your workout is.
            Weather and sweat resistant earbuds—IPX4 rated, with electronics protected against splashing water wherever you exercise. 
            <br>Simple touch controls - Instead of buttons, control your wireless earbuds with a series of simple gestures. On the right earbud, swipe up and down for optional volume control, double-tap to play or pause music and to answer calls. On the left earbud, double-tap to engage a Shortcut function like checking your battery level or skipping a track.
