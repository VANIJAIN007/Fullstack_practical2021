        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended 
        for display on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.

        Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between "<" and ">" characters) is referred to as 
        an element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate when
        some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.
